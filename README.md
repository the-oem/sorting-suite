## Sorting Suite - A Turing Mod 2 FEE Project

### Synopsis

This project contains implementations of Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. These were assignments designed to help us understand how sorting algorithms work.

### Motivation

My motivation was that this was assigned to us ;)

### Installation

Clone the repository using `git clone git@github.com:the-oem/sorting-suite.git` and run the tests.

### Tests

The sorting suite has Mocha/Chai tests that can be run entirely or as individual tests.

`npm test tests` will run all tests.

`npm test tests/(sortname-test.js)` will run the tests for that particular sorting algorithm. As an example, you can use `npm test tests/merge-test.js` to run the _Merge Sort_ tests.
