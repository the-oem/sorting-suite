## Sorting Suite - A Turing Mod 2 FEE Project

### Synopsis

This project contains implementations of Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. These were assignments designed to help us understand how sorting algorithms work.

### Code Example



Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

### Motivation

My motivation was that this was assigned to us ;)

### Installation

Clone the repository `git clone `

### Tests

The sorting suite has Mocha/Chai tests that can be run entirely or as individual tests.

`npm test tests` will run all tests.

`npm test tests/(sortname-test.js)` will run the tests for that particular sorting algorithm.
